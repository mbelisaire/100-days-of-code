# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I did the FreeCodeCamp Tribute Page Project and start the Portfolio one.

**Thoughts:** I didn't put to much effort I think... I guess I want to see things I really don't know about and work on projects I can add to my portfolio.

### Day 4: June 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I finished the FreeCodeCamp basic algorithm challenges.

**Thoughts:** I almost skipped the day because my aunt has come to see us but I still did it and I am really happy to be done with these first challenges. It was funny at times, I missed these code experiences. I am really happy to go to bed too. ^^'
