# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I did the FreeCodeCamp Tribute Page Project and start the Portfolio one.

**Thoughts:** I didn't put to much effort I think... I guess I want to see things I really don't know about and work on projects I can add to my portfolio.

### Day 2: June 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I finished the FreeCodeCamp Portfolio webpage project.

**Thoughts:** I feel good for now still without much effort... Things will get interesting very soon.
